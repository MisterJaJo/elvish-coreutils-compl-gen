# elvish-coreutils-compl-gen

elvish-coreutils-compl-gen is a library for the Elvish shell that provides completions for all GNU coreutils functions.

The completions were mostly generated by a Python script that takes the output of \<cmd\> --help and parses the result.

Manual tweaking was then applied to generate sane output and provide a nice experience.
